# My Research Project

## Summary
**Our world is dynamic!** We live in a world that spins around its axis with a period close to 24 h. This has created rhytmic changes in the environment, such as the day-night cycle, or changes in temperature, humidity, UV light. This in turn has shaped the evolution of most organisms that live on earth, which have evolved an internal time-keeping mechanism to help them predict these changes: **the circadian clock**.
